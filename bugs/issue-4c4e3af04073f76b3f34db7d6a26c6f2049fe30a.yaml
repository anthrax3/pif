title: Persist the HTTP connections during flickr updates
desc: |-
  We open a separate HTTP connection during the shorthash collection process in
  pif.flickr.FlickrIndex.
  
  Ideally, we would pool the requests by hostname. Then, dedicate a single worker
  thread per pool.
  
  Unfortunately, this change would makke the availability of the shorthash data
  be out of order. That would prevent progressive updating of the local database
  and makes crash-recovery tricky.
  
  BUT, as we're not syncing the local database until the entire collection
  process is complete ANYWAY... this seems like a totally worthwhile trade-off.
  
  Investigation of the in-memory model and writeback strategy of shelve (bsddb /
  gdbm) will need to be done in order to make this guarantee.
