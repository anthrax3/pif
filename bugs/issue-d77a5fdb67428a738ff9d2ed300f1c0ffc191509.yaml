title: FlickrUploader worker should handle upload exceptions
desc: |-
  The FlickrUploader worker thread doesn't handle exceptions from flickrapi.upload.
  
  This means UI updates will stop in the case of a connection failure.
  
  We should be handling FlickrErrors and IOErrors, at the very minimum. But,
  additional research needs to be done to determine the wide range of possible
  exceptions and their proper handling.
