title: Report empty IconView DnD issues upstream
desc: |-
  In GTK 2.14, empty IconViews are insensitive to being drag and drop destinations.
  
  The bug is pretty accurately documented here: http://www.gtkforums.com/about2772.html
  
  Our workaround was to stub an "empty" IconView with an invisible item.
  
  We should bug upstream.
