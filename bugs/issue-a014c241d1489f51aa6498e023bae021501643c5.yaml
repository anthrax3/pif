title: UI should handle upload failure better
desc: |-
  When an upload fails, the entire upload process is canceled.
  
  Currently, we then pop a non-modal alert with the text "Upload failed!" If they
  click that alert, the application closes.
  
  We should remember which photos were marked to be uploaded to Flickr. Then,
  restart and resync with Flickr. Any marked photos that were successfully
  uploaded should disappear from the view. But, the previously marked photos
  should remain marked.
  
  Sorting is a long and arduous task. The loss of a net connection or Flickr
  going down shouldn't revert work.
